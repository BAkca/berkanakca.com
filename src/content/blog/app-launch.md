### Campaign Summary

We partnered with a **local marketplace app** targeting Gen Z users in Turkey. The goal: launch, scale installs, and keep acquisition cost below $0.50 per user.

### Key Tactics

- TikTok video ads tailored to Gen Z (humor, native cuts, influencer tone)  
- Firebase A/B testing for onboarding flows  
- Aggressive CPI optimization with audience exclusions and lookalikes

### Results

- 📱 50,000+ installs in 90 days  
- 💰 $0.38 cost per install (CPI)  
- 🔁 27% re-engagement within 30 days

> Gen Z campaigns require creative velocity. TikTok’s lean format combined with Firebase feedback loops helped us crush KPIs at launch.
