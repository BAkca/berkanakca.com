In performance marketing, a single-platform mindset is outdated. Real growth happens when you orchestrate channels like **Google Ads**, **Meta**, **Criteo**, and **Amazon Ads** into a unified funnel.

Hereâ€™s how I build multi-stage funnels that convert â€” with examples and results from campaigns Iâ€™ve personally managed.

## ðŸŽ¯ Funnel-First Thinking

> You donâ€™t scale channels. You scale **flows** across channels.

A well-structured funnel ensures:
- Your message matches user intent at each stage
- You maximize return from every platformâ€™s unique strength
- Budgets adapt to where users are in the journey

## ðŸ§  Cross-Platform Funnel Breakdown

| Stage | Goal | Platforms | Creative |
|-------|------|-----------|----------|
| TOFU (Top of Funnel) | Awareness / Discovery | Google Display, YouTube Ads, Meta Video, Amazon DSP | Short-form video, lifestyle images, product-in-context |
| MOFU (Middle of Funnel) | Consideration | Google Search, Meta Retargeting, Criteo Dynamic | Product demos, testimonials, limited-time benefits |
| BOFU (Bottom of Funnel) | Conversion | Brand Search, Amazon Sponsored Products, Cart Abandonment Retargeting | Urgency copy, coupon callouts, trust signals |

## ðŸ§ª Real Campaign Framework (Fashion E-Commerce, Black Friday)

**Channels Used**:  
- **TOFU**: YouTube Shorts, Meta Reels, GDN  
- **MOFU**: Google Search + Criteo Dynamic Retargeting  
- **BOFU**: Amazon Sponsored Display + Meta Custom Audiences  

ðŸ“Š Results:
- CTR: +47% vs. Q3 benchmark  
- ROAS: 6.2x overall  
- CPA: 19% below target

## ðŸ’¸ Budget Distribution

Test-proven split (start):
- 50% TOFU  
- 30% MOFU  
- 20% BOFU  

Adapt based on platform ROAS + audience saturation.

## ðŸ§° My Tech Stack

- **Google Ads & GA4** (tracking + bid strategy)
- **Criteo** (catalog-based re-engagement)
- **Meta Ads** (creative testing)
- **Amazon Ads Console** (retail-ready bottom-funnel)
- **Looker Studio** (reporting dashboard for clients)

---

## âœ… Pro Tips

- Donâ€™t reuse creatives across stages â€” intent > format.
- Match KPIs to funnel stage: CPM/CTR (TOFU), CVR/ROAS (BOFU).
- Blend brand + performance â€” especially for repeat-purchase verticals.

## ðŸ§  Final Thought

The best campaigns feel seamless to the user â€” even if they saw your brand across 5 platforms. Thatâ€™s growth management.
